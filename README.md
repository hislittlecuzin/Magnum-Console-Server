# Magnum-Console-Server

This is the source code to the depricated version of the project. 

The project will be redone and adapted to be fully free/open source in an engine without the use of a dedicated server. 

The goal of this project was to rent servers to communities & allows easy modding with scripting & open source clients. The only goal now is to make the game. This code is no longer being worked on. The new version of the game will be written custom to a game engine. Likely Unity.
